Travellingwave Filter Bank Algorithm

We are currently working on adding comments in the code, creating documentation for the code and data sets, and generating suitable samples for easy reproduction of results. Additionally an Android Mobile application is also being developed, so users can use can simply speak and have the app display the acoustic signatures and codes. All of this will be made available here (https://github.com/travellingwave/TFB) by December 2022.
